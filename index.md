# About

I started my career with a degree in Civil Engineering and found myself working as a civil engineering consultant with a passion for the interplay between civil engineering and the digital world. I also briefly dabbled in structural engineering for a while. Then my professional path steered towards the integration of GIS and spatial analysis, particularly focusing on Flood Consequence Assessment reports. This involved processing and presentation of spatial information in the context of planning advice framework on flooding, particularly Technical Advice Note 15 (TAN15) in Wales.

I currently operate under my own consultancy venture, Obermajer, specialising as a Flood Consequence Assessment consultant. This role capitalises on my expertise in integrating GIS and spatial analysis to deliver comprehensive Flood Consequence Assessment reports, in accordance with TAN15. Discover more about my consultancy services and projects [here](/FCA/).

My interest also grew beyond traditional engineering. I have been dabbling in programming, focusing on Python, while also engaging with C#, AutoLISP and VLISP, among others. I’ve used Python to work with libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, mainly in Jupyter Notebooks. Additionally, I've created bespoke tools to streamline civil engineering design processes. See more on this topic [here](/ober-civils-tookit/).

I’m always looking to grow and learn more. Currently, I’m keen on enhancing my skills in SQL, bits of R, and diving deeper into TensorFlow and Keras. I’m working on a few side projects that utilise these technologies. One involves utilising Convolutional Neural Networks in drainage pipe defect detection from drainage survey footage. I’m also exploring the use of RNN sequence-to-sequence traduction in binary analysis. I’m generally all about finding smarter ways to solve problems and making things work better.

I enjoy sharing what I learn and connecting with others who are interested in tech and engineering. If you’re into these things too, feel free to [reach out](mailto:patryk.obermajer@gmail.com). Let’s chat about innovation, technology, and how we can create something great together.
