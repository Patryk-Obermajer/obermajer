<!-- # Clarification for developers regarding the use of Development Advice Map and Flood Map for Planning  -->

There has been a lot of confusion since the announcement of the new TAN 15 three years ago. The maps which accompany the old TAN 15 (2004)[^1], Development Advice Map (DAM) is to be replaced with the new updated Flood Map for Planning (FMfP) which come with the New TAN 15[^2]. But then the introduction of New TAN15 got postponed past the original date in 2021. And its still being reviewed. The maps stayed. But there are rather big differences in terms of terminology and the flood zones differ between DAM and FMfP. The old DAM maps that accompanied the old TAN15 did not take into account the climate change allowance. Here's the summary:

***Development Advice Map***[^3]
<table>
  <tr>
    <th width=100>DAM Zone</th>
    <th>Description of Zone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone A</b></td>
    <td>Considered to be at little or no risk of fluvial or tidal/coastal flooding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone B</b></td>
    <td>Areas known to have been flooded in the past evidenced by sedimentary deposits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone C</b></td>
    <td>Based on Environment Agency extreme flood outline, equal to or greater than <b>1 in 1000</b> chance of flooding in a given year (river, tidal or coastal).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone C1</b></td>
    <td>Areas of the floodplain which are developed and served by significant infrastructure, including flood defences.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone C2</b></td>
    <td>Areas of the floodplain without significant flood defence infrastructure.</td>
  </tr>
</table>



As we can observe, the most extreme scenario does not include the climate change allowance.

Here's a summary of Flood Map for Planning.

***Flood Map for Planning***[^4]
<table>
  <tr>
    <th width=100>FMfP Zone</th>
    <th>Description of Zone</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone 1</b></td>
    <td>Less than <b>1 in 1000</b> (plus climate change) chance of flooding in a given year (from Rivers, the Sea, and Surface Water).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone 2</b></td>
    <td>Less than <b>1 in 100</b> (from <b>Rivers</b> and <b>Surface Water</b>) and less than <b>1 in 200</b> (from <b>the Sea</b>) but greater than<b> 1 in 1000</b> chance of flooding in a given year (all sources), including climate change.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Zone 3</b></td>
    <td>A greater than <b>1 in 100</b> (from <b>Rivers</b> and <b>Surface Water</b>) and greater than <b>1 in 200</b> (from <b>the Sea</b>) chance of flooding in a given year, including climate change</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>TAN 15 Defended Zones</b></td>
    <td>Areas where flood risk management infrastructure provides a minimum standard of protection against flooding from <b>Rivers</b> of <b>1:100</b> or the <b>Sea</b> of <b>1:200</b>, (plus climate change and freeboard). Does not apply to flooding from Surface Water and Small Watercourses</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Main Changes
Crucially, climate change has been applied to all flood zones in Flood Map for Planning as opposed to Development Advice Map, which only shows the current state and there's no CC allowance. Zone B of DAM (i.e. known to have been flooded in the past but the zone extent is not related to any particular return period) has been scrapped completely. A new flood zone, i.e. Flood Zone 3 has been introduced.

## Current Use
Even though the 'old' TAN15 is still in force, FMfP are used as advisory as "they provide a more accurate". It is therefore used.

## Why it matters
Thanks to the application of Climate Change allowance to flood zones, areas which had been previously considered flood free are now included in Flood Zones. What is important, the extents of 1 in 100 year event (from Rivers) or 1 in 200 (from the Sea) are often greater than the 1 in 1000 year event without the Climate Change allowance. This renders a lot of land unavailable for, especially residential, development.
