### Expertise in Flood Consequence Assessments
We specialise in the creation of comprehensive Flood Consequence Assessments (FCAs) to support planning applications. Our reports are known for precision and clarity.

We bring to the table experience in addressing both highly vulnerable and less vulnerable developments in line with Technical Advice Note 15 (TAN15).
We have a proven track record of successfully demonstrating compliance with Acceptability of Consequences and Justification Tests required in the more challenging cases. Our reports are crafted to meet the expectations of clients and pass review processes by both local planning authorities and Natural Resources Wales.

We are adept at processing and integrating Flood Risk Data, including Model Outputs (former Product 5) and Model Reports (also known as Product 6) information provided by NRW, into our reports in a clear and accessible format. This integration ensures that our assessments are robust and aligned with the latest practices. This is especially important since NRW stopped providing site specific Map/Data (also known as Product 4) and shifted the onus of producing flood risk information to the developer and their consultant.

Our strength is in our precision—utilising GIS spatial data analysis, we present Flood Risk Data clearly and accurately. This ensures that decision-makers grasp the full scope of the assessed risks.
