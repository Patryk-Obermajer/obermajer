I began my journey with a degree in Civil Engineering and became a civil engineering consultant. My day to day work combines traditional engineering and digital tech. I also briefly explored structural engineering and then my focus steered to Geographic Information System (GIS) within the civil engineering field and Flood Consequence Assessments.

## Current Role
I currently operate under my own consultancy venture specialising as a Flood Risk Consultant. This role allows me to apply my GIS experience to produce clear and well-structured Flood Consequence Assessment reports, in accordance with Technical Advice Note 15 (TAN15). Discover more about the consultancy services [here](/FCA/).

## Beyond Traditional Engineering
My interests also extend beyond civil and structural engineering. I'm a keen programmer with a focus on Python (I'm a big fan of Jupyter Notebooks), while also engaging a bit with .NET, AutoLISP and VLISP, and others. I’ve worked with Python libraries like beautifulsoup, selenium, pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. I've also created bespoke tools to streamline civil engineering design processes. See more on this topic [here](https://patryk-obermajer.github.io/help.html).

I’m currently working on enhancing my skills in SQL, bits of R, diving deeper into Keras/TensorFlow, and all things Python but I'm also open to dive into other languages and subject areas. I’m working on a number of side projects that make use of these technologies. One involves utilising Convolutional Neural Networks in drainage pipe defect detection from drainage survey footage. I’m also exploring the use of RNN sequence-to-sequence traduction in binary analysis.

## Let's Connect
I enjoy sharing what I learn and connecting with others who are interested in tech and engineering. If you’re into these things too, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:patryk.obermajer@gmail.com). Let’s chat about innovation, technology, and how we can create something great together.
